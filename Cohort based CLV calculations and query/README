Revenue by Week Since Registration Analysis
This SQL query performs an in-depth analysis of user behavior by calculating revenue generated by users in the weeks following their registration.
It is designed for datasets tracking user events, specifically focusing on user registrations and purchases.

Overview
The query is structured into two main parts: calculating the first registration week for each user and calculating the revenue from purchases for each week after registration.
The goal is to analyze user engagement and revenue generation over time, providing valuable insights into how long users continue to generate revenue after they first register.

Structure
The analysis is carried out in several steps, each represented as a Common Table Expression (CTE) or a main SELECT statement:

UserRegistration CTE: Identifies the week each user registered by finding the earliest event timestamp.
This CTE is essential for establishing a baseline from which to measure user engagement and revenue generation.

UserPurchase CTE: Focuses on purchase events, extracting the week each purchase was made and the associated revenue.
This information is crucial for understanding revenue flow from users over time.

Main SELECT Statement: Combines the data from the UserRegistration and UserPurchase CTEs to calculate the total registrations for each week
and the revenue generated from these users for the first 12 weeks following their registration.

Key Metrics Calculated
TotalRegistrations: The total number of users registered in each week.
RevenueWeekX: The total revenue generated in the Xth week after registration, where X ranges from 0 to 12. This allows for a detailed analysis of how revenue from users changes over time.
Implementation
This query is designed for Google BigQuery and leverages specific functions such as DATE_TRUNC, TIMESTAMP_MICROS, and DATE_ADD for date manipulation. To use this query:

Ensure your dataset has a structure compatible with the query, specifically with event_timestamp, user_pseudo_id, and purchase_revenue_in_usd fields.
Modify the table reference (turing_data_analytics.raw_events) to match your dataset's path.
Usage
This query is particularly useful for businesses and analysts seeking to understand how user engagement and revenue contribution evolve after the user's initial registration.
It can help in identifying trends, forecasting revenue, and tailoring marketing strategies to enhance user retention and value.

Output
The final output provides a weekly breakdown of user registrations and the subsequent revenue generated by these users up to 12 weeks post-registration.
This detailed view can help in identifying key periods of user engagement and potential opportunities for enhancing user experience and retention strategies.
