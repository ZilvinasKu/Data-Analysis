Predicting Coronary Heart Disease Risk

--Project Overview

This project utilizes logistic regression to predict the 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) based on the Framingham Heart Study dataset.
Through meticulous data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, we've identified key predictors of CHD risk and adjusted our model to prioritize the detection of high-risk individuals.

--Installation

To set up your environment to run this code, you will need Python and several Python packages.

--Prerequisites

Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn


--The dataset underwent thorough preprocessing, including:

-Handling missing values by imputing with median values for continuous variables and mode values for categorical variables.
-Standardizing features using StandardScaler to ensure a consistent scale across all variables.

--Model Training

A logistic regression model was chosen for its efficiency in handling binary outcomes, like CHD risk.
The data was split into an 80/20 train-test ratio, and the model was trained using standardized features to optimize performance.

--Model Evaluation and Adjustment

Initial model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
To decrease the incidence of false negatives, the decision threshold was adjusted, improving the model's sensitivity to detecting CHD risk.

--Key Findings

Age, systolic blood pressure (sysBP), cigarettes per day, male gender, and glucose levels were identified as significant predictors of CHD risk.
Adjusting the decision threshold enhanced the model's ability to identify individuals at risk, prioritizing sensitivity over specificity.

--Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of logistic regression in predicting CHD risk, providing valuable insights into the relationship between various predictors and CHD.
Future work could explore more complex models or incorporate additional predictors to further enhance predictive performance.
