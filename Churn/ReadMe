# Subscription Analysis Query

This repository contains an SQL query designed to analyze subscription retention over a six-week period. The analysis is crucial for understanding user behavior and retention trends, offering insights that can help tailor marketing strategies and improve service offerings.

## Overview

The query operates on a dataset of subscription start and end dates, tracking how many users begin a subscription in a given week and remain subscribed in the weeks following. This longitudinal analysis provides a window into the effectiveness of engagement and retention strategies.

## Features

- **Weekly Cohort Analysis**: Users who start a subscription in the same week are grouped into cohorts for analysis.
- **Retention Tracking**: For each cohort, the query calculates how many users remain subscribed for up to six weeks after their initial subscription date.
- **Flexible Time Frames**: Though focused on a six-week period, the query can be easily modified to examine longer or shorter durations.

## Data Structure

The query expects a `subscriptions` table with at least the following columns:

- `user_pseudo_id`: A unique identifier for each user.
- `subscription_start`: The start date of the subscription.
- `subscription_end`: The end date of the subscription (can be `NULL` if the subscription is ongoing).

## Usage

To use this query, ensure your database contains a `subscriptions` table structured as described above. Replace `turing_data_analytics.subscriptions` with the appropriate table reference in your database.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improving this query or have developed additional analyses based on this structure, please feel free to open an issue or pull request.
